# plworld_generator

This is a simple Python project that generates random worlds using Perlin-like noise.
It prints the map directly in the terminal using ASCII characters, and can also save a PNG preview.

Each time you run it, it creates a different world with mountains, grasslands, and oceans â€” all procedurally generated
